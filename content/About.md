I am Mehmet Can. I love Digital TV.

I work @ Admongrel as Head of Sales & Partnerships. My professional interest is Digital TV. I help broadcasters and Pay-TV Operators to engage with their viewers and keep them happy.

I specialize in Interactive TV, Addressable TV and HbbTV. I also like Set-Top-Box's and have some knowledge in DVB-S/C/T and IPTV STB domain.

## Never Ending Learning Process

I am currently pursuing MSc. degree at Istanbul Technical University. I focus on Electronics Communications and Applications.

I've started writing my thesis on "Modelling the coverage and cost-effectiveness of 5G Rollout Scenarios in Turkey." I hope to publish it at the beginning of 2020.
